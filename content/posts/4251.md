Overview

SharePoint Insights is a new hybrid IT service that provides advanced telemetry for IT Professionals in SharePoint Server 2016.  SharePoint Insights collects anonymous usage and audit data and processes it in the cloud providing IT insight into how their users are using SharePoint enabling IT to _deploy its resources more effectively while the organization realizes greater value from both people and systems._

Getting Started with SharePoint Insights
========================================

Prior to completing the steps below, ensure the Usage and Health Data Collection has been provisioned and **Simple Log Event Usage Data\_SPUnifiedAuditEntry** is enabled for logging.  See illustration below:

See below for instructions on configuring Usage and Health Data Collection and Usage Data Logging Events.

Configure Usage and Health Data Collection
------------------------------------------

SharePoint Server 2016 writes usage and health data to the logging folder and to the logging database. You can use the SharePoint Central Administration website to configure health data collection settings.

1.  Verify that you have the following administrative credentials:
    
    The user account that performs this procedure has to be a member of the Farm Administrators group.
    
2.  In Central Administration, on the home page, click **Monitoring**.
    
3.  On the Monitoring page, in the **Reporting** section, click **Configure usage and health data collection**.
    
4.  On the Configure usage and health data collection page, in the **Usage Data Collection** section, select the **Enable usage data collection** check box.
    
5.  In the **Event Selection** section, select the check boxes of the events that you want to log.
    
    Logging uses system resources and can affect performance and disk usage. Only log those events for which you want regular reports.
    
    For impromptu reports or investigations, enable logging for events, and then disable logging for the events after the report or investigation is complete. For more information, see [Configure usage data collection for events by using Windows PowerShell](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee663480.aspx#section3).
    
6.  In the **Usage Data Collection Settings** section, type the path of the folder to which you want usage and health information to be written in the **Log file location** box. The path that you specify must exist on each server in the farm.
    
    These settings are applied to all events.
    
7.  In the **Health Data Collection** section, select the **Enable health data collection** check box. To change the collection schedules, click **Health Logging Schedule**. You can see a list of timer jobs that collect health data. Click any of the timer jobs to change its schedule, or disable that timer job. If you disable a timer job, it stops collecting corresponding health data. For more information, see [Timer job reference (SharePoint 2013)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc678870.aspx).
    
8.  To change log collection schedules, click **Log Collection Schedule**, and then click any of the timer jobs to change its schedule, or disable that timer job. If you disable a timer job, it stops collecting corresponding log data.
    
9.  In the **Logging Database Server** section, to change the authentication method, select either the **Windows authentication** or **SQL authentication** option.
    
    To change the **Database Server** and **Database Name** values, you must use Windows PowerShell. For more information, see [Log usage data in a different Logging Database by using Windows PowerShell](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee663480.aspx#section4).

> 
> Set-SPUsageDefinition –Identity “Simple Log Event Usage Data\_SPUnifiedAuditEntry” –Enable –DaysRetained 7
> 
> Set-SPUsageDefinition –Identity “Simple Log Event Usage Data\_UserEngagement” –Enable –DaysRetained 7

Configure Unified Logging
-------------------------

In SharePoint Server 2016 IT Preview Unified Logging is disabled by default.  To enable Unified Logging:

1.  Verify that you have the following memberships:
    
    *   **securityadmin** fixed server role on the SQL Server instance.
    *   **db\_owner** fixed database role on all databases that are to be updated.
    *   Administrators group on the server on which you are running the Windows PowerShell cmdlets.
2.  On the **Start** menu, click **All Programs**.
    
3.  Click **Microsoft SharePoint 2013 Products**.
    
4.  Click **SharePoint 2013 Management Shell**.
    
5.  At the Windows PowerShell command prompt, type the following command:
    

> (Get-SPFarm).UnifiedAuditLogEnabled
> 
> $spi \= Get-SPFarm
> 
> $spi.UnifiedAuditLogEnabled \= $True
> 
> $spi.Update()

Confirm the results of (Get-SPFarm).UnifiedAuditLogEnabled is true.

Confirm Unified Audit Log is Enabled
------------------------------------

Once Unified Logging has been enabled in the farm, validate usage data is being collected:

1.  Open a Document Library and perform a file action to include editing, deleting, moving, and/or renaming a document.
    
2.  Navigate to C:Program FilesCommon FilesMicrosoft SharedWeb Server Extensions16Logs and confirm a new directory **SPUnifiedAuditEntry** exists.
    
3.  Open SPUnifiedAuditEntry in Windows Explorer and verify a new .tmp file exists.  If true enter New-SPUsageLogFile in Windows PowerShell to generate a new usage log.
