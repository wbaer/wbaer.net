This summer we introduced a [consistent, coherent sharing experience across the Web and desktop](https://blogs.office.com/en-us/2017/05/16/new-sharepoint-and-onedrive-capabilities-accelerate-your-digital-transformation-2/) – these improvements allow you to share Office 365 files directly from File Explorer on PC and Finder on Mac, in addition to the latest versions of Office on the desktop and Office 365 web experiences. The updates we made provide a simplified sharing experience, so you can share files and folders easily with partners both internal and external, while retaining the right level of security – so whether you share on the web, in Explorer on Windows 10 and Windows 7, or Finder or the Mac, the sharing experience is secure, consistent and simple. While we’ve made the sharing experience consistent across these endpoints we also understand that data loss and leakage are non-negotiable and to comply with business standards and industry regulations, organizations need to protect sensitive information and prevent its inadvertent disclosure. To ensure your sensitive data remains that way we’re excited to announce that we’ve extended sharing to include DLP policy tips across OneDrive, SharePoint, Word, Excel and PowerPoint on PC, Mac and Web, so whether you’re working on the web or the desktop, you can remain informed with a consistent policy tip experience as you share files.
