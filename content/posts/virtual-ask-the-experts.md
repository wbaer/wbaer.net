One of my favorite components to any conference is ATE (Ask the Experts), which based on the overall response recently at the Microsoft Office SharePoint Server Conference 2008, is both popular and extremely valuable in providing an opportunity for open discourse and topic-based discussion.  With that in mind, I have often considered the concept of a virtual ATE on my blog.  While I generally prepare and deliver content based on what the community has most often requested or where I feel there is desire for more information, I'd like to give the concept of a virtual ATE here.

So with that said, the premise is I will take questions related to SharePoint Products and Technologies and provide a response to either the most commonly asked question or the most compelling questions...while I cannot possibly answer every question, I will do my best to address questions based on the above premise in an upcoming post.  Questions can be submitted through either the [contact form](http://blogs.technet.com/wbaer/contact.aspx) on this blog or via the [comments](http://blogs.technet.com/wbaer/archive/2008/03/15/virtual-ask-the-experts.aspx#comments) area of this post through March 31st in response to ATE.
