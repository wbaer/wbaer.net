I was browsing for **SharePoint** add-ons and integration features this evening and came across this one from [Dark Blue Duck](http://www.darkblueduck.com/); [Scanning Enabler](http://www.darkblueduck.com/Products/ScanningEnablerWSS.aspx).  The reason I decided to post on this particular add-on is that I could see the immediate value from the capacity to take desktop scanning to **SharePoint Products and Technologies**, seamlessly and transparently.  The product specifications include key features, to include, integration will Doc and PicLibs, enabled at the Web Application level providing the functionality to all Site Collections and workspaces, supports custom metadata capture and workflow, and supports localization.  The [Scanning Enabler](http://www.darkblueduck.com/Products/ScanningEnablerWSS.aspx) is available for **SharePoint Portal Server 2003**, **Windows SharePoint Services 2.0**, and **Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007**.
