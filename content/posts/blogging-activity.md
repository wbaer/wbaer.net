After having spent the last two weeks in the Colorado Rockies, I've unfortunately have had very little time to blog; albeit, most of the time was spent digging out from the numerous blizzards which seem determined to keep me indoors during my vacation :-)Â  I'll be spending the next few days organizing and consolidating posts and cleaning up some older posts, but have some great upcoming material beneficial to those both deploying and developing on **Windows SharePoint Services 3.0** and **Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007** in the next couple of weeks....Stay tuned!
