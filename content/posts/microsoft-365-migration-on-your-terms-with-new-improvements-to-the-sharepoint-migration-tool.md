We’re excited to announce new improvements to the SharePoint Migration Tool for the month of February. Designed to be used for migrations ranging from the smallest set of files to a large scale enterprise migration, the SharePoint Migration Tool will let you bring your information to the cloud and take advantage of the latest collaboration, intelligence, and security solutions with Office 365. Over the past several months we’ve been continually working to add features to the SharePoint Migration Tool to help you accelerate your journey to Microsoft 365, from support for full site migrations, to incremental improvements to the user experience – the SharePoint Migration Tool is designed to support migrations of all sizes. This month we’re adding some exciting new improvements to help you on your journey to the cloud. Improvements this month include: **Managed Metadata Service support** If you have an existing taxonomy in SharePoint Server 2013, the SharePoint Migration Tool can now migrate your content types and term stores to Office 365. Global term store migration requires global tenant admin permissions. **Web Parts Support, Site Navigation, and more…** The SharePoint Migration Tool has continuously improved to support more complex migration requirements. From a humble beginning of accelerating files migration to incremental improvements leading up to complete SharePoint 2013 site migrations. Now using the SharePoint Migration Tool you can migrate just about every element of SharePoint sites that you care most about including Web Parts, Pages, and site navigation!

The SPMT may be fine for the big total site migrations, but I have 100 subdirectories under Shared Documents and several subdirectories under those. I wish to migrate a subdirectory of a subdirectory. when I try to input the url for that subdir, I'm being prompted to sign in again and the program is rejecting that sign in. (It's the spsfarm account). Why can't we select the dub directories from the drop down? who should I report issues to? I love the idea of this program, but if it cant do granular migrations, what's the use?

Thanks Rob. I'm assuming based on the scenario outlined you're using either CSV or JSON to migrate subdirectories from the source. Is the ask to support directory browsing using the SPMT user interface? If so, I'll bring this recommendation to the team. On support, as an Office 365 subscriber you can open a support request against SPMT.

Thanks Greg. I'm assuming the migration specified is SharePoint (on-premises) to SharePoint Online?

I am looking for a tool to simply migrate documents from on-prem My Sites to OneDrive for Business. SPMT sounds like the perfect tool for that, but so far it seems to be doing a lot more than I want. Even with turning off all of the options, in testing I noticed it is still copying over the site title, site description, content types, etc. I really wish there was an option to just copy files and leave everything else alone. It sounds like V1 was the tool I am looking for. It would be nice if all of the new features could be disabled.
