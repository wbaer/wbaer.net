In early November, Microsoft announced the Microsoft Certified Master for Office SharePoint Server 2007 and the Microsoft Certified Architect for Office SharePoint Server 2007.  \[See [http://blogs.msdn.com/sharepoint/archive/2008/11/10/introducing-the-microsoft-certified-master-and-certified-architect-for-sharepoint.aspx](http://blogs.msdn.com/sharepoint/archive/2008/11/10/introducing-the-microsoft-certified-master-and-certified-architect-for-sharepoint.aspx)\] 

I was fortunate in that I had the opportunity to spend three (3) weeks in this first rotation of the program and was extremely impressed, not only with the depth and breadth of the knowledge that was made available throughout the three (3) weeks, but also the ability to collaborate with the brilliant instructors and students alike.  While a challenging undertaking that takes a  focused level of commitment, it was well worth the investment and comes as a definite recommendation for those seeking the top-tier technical certification for SharePoint Products and Technologies.
