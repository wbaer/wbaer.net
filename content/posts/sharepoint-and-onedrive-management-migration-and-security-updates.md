SharePoint Admin Center Preview
===============================

ROLLING OUT NOW TO TARGETED RELEASE ON 2/1 Innovation in the cloud drives tremendous business value, and it delivers new capabilities to the IT professionals who work tirelessly to support, configure, administer, and secure their organizations' content and services. While our new user experiences are designed to be simpler, more intuitive, and more powerful we also believe administration should be just as simple, just as intuitive, and just as powerful, and to that we're introducing a completely revamped SharePoint Admin center that draws heavily on our modern principles. An administrative console designed to help IT achieve more, so their users can achieve more. For Targeted Release customers the option to try the new SharePoint Admin Center will be available through the existing administration experience for SharePoint Online (see illustration below).  This permits the use of both administrative experiences as we continue to refine and add capabilities to the new admin center that are currently not present in the existing administrative experience. ![](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2018/01/SPOAdmin.png)
