_Governments around the world are strengthening laws and regulations to protect citizens’ data, preserve national security, and protect business interests._ Last week at Microsoft Ignite we announced new Multi-Geo Capabilities in Office 365 to help ensure you remain compliant with services to include SharePoint, OneDrive, and Exchange. The new Multi-Geo Capabilities in Microsoft 365 with SharePoint and OneDrive provide global organizations a solution to maximizing the value of Office 365, including SharePoint and OneDrive, while meeting data residency and compliance requirements. Multi-geo capabilities provide you with a choice of geographical locations in which to store, manage, and secure your data by allowing a single Office 365 tenant to span multiple regions, storing data on a per-user or per-site basis.  So, whether you’re adding a new user to your organization or need to move an existing user, as well as their data, seamlessly and transparently to that user, to a new region, new multi-geo capabilities are designed to address those needs.

Information about multi-geo enabled Tenants such as geo locations, groups, and user information, is mastered in Azure Active Directory (AAD).  Since the Tenant information is mastered centrally and synchronized into each geo location, sharing and experiences involving anyone from your company contain global awareness.  For example, a user whose preferred OneDrive data location in Europe, can share with users in North America or other configured geo locations, and discover content created across the tenancy using services such as search and Office Delve.  In addition, independent policies can be configured at each geo location to include explicit sharing policies, eDiscovery, etc. Multi-Geo capabilities for OneDrive is in private preview today.
