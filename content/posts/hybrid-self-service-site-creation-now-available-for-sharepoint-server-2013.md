While SharePoint Online in Office 365 is an attractive alternative to on-premises business solutions with SharePoint. You might want to or need to deploy specific solutions in the cloud while still maintaining your on-premises investments or gradually move to cloud using a staged, workload-driven approach. Hybrid scenarios with Office 365 and SharePoint on-premises allow you to bring the cloud to your business while bringing the business to the cloud. Today we’re pleased to announce the availability of hybrid self-service site creation for customers of SharePoint Server 2013. New hybrid self-service site creation allows SharePoint administrators to direct users site creations requests to Office 365. This new hybrid capability allows administrators of SharePoint Server 2013 to have the option to enable their existing or new Self-Service Site Creation flow redirect users to SharePoint Online to create a Group (with an associated Team Site). SharePoint administrators can turn this feature on or off on the [Self-service Site Collection Management](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc263483.aspx) page, accessible from SharePoint 2013 Central Administration. This capability is included in the March 2017 Public Update available later today. Download the March 2017 Public Update for SharePoint Server 2013 at [https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt715807(v=office.16).aspx#BKMK\_2013](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt715807(v=office.16).aspx#BKMK_2013).

When selecting this option any hybrid user that goes to the Self-service Site Creation page (/\_layouts/15/scsignup.aspx) will be redirected to SharePoint Online Group creation, and will be able to create a Group and associated Team Site in the Cloud using the new modern group creation flow. Hybrid users are defined through inclusion in one or more audiences as configured when enabling the hybrid sites feature in SharePoint Server 2013.

In addition to the configuration options available directly through SharePoint 2013 Central Administration, there will also be entry points to the configuration page through a one-time Central Administration alert box and from the [Hybrid Picker in Office 365](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt346117.aspx). \[office src="https://onedrive.live.com/embed?cid=DB2A854820FFC537&resid=DB2A854820FFC537%2167777&authkey=ADeAzqOAfBbh-2I" width="320" height="180"\] The cloud is no longer a luxury—it’s central to a mobile, modern workplace—and Office 365 brings the cloud to you, on your terms and across SharePoint and OneDrive we’re constantly working to help you take advantage of the power of Office 365. Kick start the journey to the cloud with hybrid self-service site creation today.
