Seattle → Amsterdam → The Hague → Seattle (TechReady6) → SharePoint Conference 2008.

February has been an amazing month for myself and SharePoint, having the opportunity to promote the platform in Europe and discuss security and data protection with SharePoint in Seattle at TechReady6, a whitepaper published, _and a birthday in between_ ;-).  I won't be presenting at the [SharePoint Conference](http://www.mssharepointconference.com/Pages/default.aspx) (I always say that and always find myself doing so), but will be present at the conference and represented during the Ask the Experts session on Wednesday, March 5th, 2008 11:00 A.M. - 1:30 P.M. Hall 4AB (Washington State Convention and Trade Center), stop by say hi and bring your questions.  This is shaping up to be one of the best conferences dedicated to SharePoint Products and Technologies I can recall.

I look forward to seeing everyone there!
