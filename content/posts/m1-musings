More or less a random musing...

Today is just shy of 3 weeks since I received my M1 MacBook Pro (MPB) and I while I had experienced some initial issues (now resolved), I can say the experience thusfar has been a positive one.  

The performance improvements are unquestionable - my current MBP (Apple Silicon, 16GB MBP) is replacing a mid-2017 (Intel i5, 16GB MBP), both with 512GB storage.  While I don't often perform resource intensive tasks, I wanted my new MBP to represent its predecessor as closely as possible to compare overall performance.
