Unified eDiscovery and Data Loss Prevention in Office 365 allows Tenant Administrators to create, manage, and secure content from a unified console (Office 365 Security and Compliance Center). To date, Tenant Administrators have had to manage Data Loss Prevention for SharePoint, OneDrive for Business, and Exchange in two separate locations, the Office 365 Security and Compliance Center and the Exchange Admin Center respectively.  In January 2017, Data Loss Prevention was centralized for SharePoint, OneDrive for Business and Exchange in the Office 365 Security and Compliance Center.  This unified Data Loss Prevention platform allows you to manage a variety of Office 365 scenarios through a single management layer – reducing time spent configuring and organizing policies across tools.

In both cases, you will still be able to edit and run existing searches in the Exchange Admin Center and work with existing cases in the SharePoint eDiscovery Center. [![sc-disc-all](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2017/02/SC-Disc-All-300x169.png)](http://wbaer.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/9b28e-sc-disc-all.png) These discrete solutions are being disabled due to their limited breadth across Office 365 services.  The Security & Compliance Center supports permissions, cases, holds and exports as well as Advanced eDiscovery features such as Themes, Email Threading, Near Duplicate Detections, and Predictive coding.  These changes only apply to the Exchange Admin Center in Exchange Online and the eDiscovery Center in SharePoint Online. These changes do not impact any existing policies, searches or holds created via the EAC, and you will still be able to create new email DLP policies in the EAC (you will not be able to create new eDiscovery searches and In-Place Holds after July 1, 2017). However, it’s recommended to use the new DLP management experience in the Office 365 Security and Compliance Center, as this is where new capabilities will be delivered in the future.
