I've spent the past several days in Portland, Oregon speaking at a SharePoint Products and Technologies governance event and completely neglected to post any information on the now released Windows SharePoint Services 3.0 and Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 Service Pack 1.  For more information visit:  [http://blogs.msdn.com/sharepoint/archive/2007/12/11/announcing-the-release-of-wss-3-0-sp1-and-office-sharepoint-server-2007-sp1.aspx](http://blogs.msdn.com/sharepoint/archive/2007/12/11/announcing-the-release-of-wss-3-0-sp1-and-office-sharepoint-server-2007-sp1.aspx).
