Today at the [SharePoint Virtual Summit](https://aka.ms/SharePointSummit), we unveiled the latest innovations for SharePoint and OneDrive, including powerful integrations across Office 365, Windows and Azure - and while we continue to drive forward with a cloud-first, mobile-first vision - security and compliance are at the foundation of everything we do. Microsoft has been building enterprise software for decades and running some of the largest online services in the world. We draw from this experience to keep making SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business more secure for users, implementing and continuously improving security-aware software development, operational management, and threat-mitigation practices that are essential to the strong protection of your services and data. The collaboration landscape has changed. Connectivity is ubiquitous and the ability to work remotely has become an ingrained part of the work practice. People have come to expect to be able to access email and documents from anywhere on any device - and for that experience to be seamless. While this has been an enormous boost to productivity, it also presents huge challenges for security. Previously, businesses needed to concern themselves with a firewall that ended at the corporate boundary. Now that boundary has shifted to the end user. Businesses need to ensure sure that corporate data is safe while enabling users to stay productive in today's mobile-first world, where the threat landscape is increasingly complex and sophisticated.

To begin with, Microsoft has continued to evolve with new standards and regulations. This has been a guiding principle as we think about security for SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business. Right alongside that principle is this one: There is no security without usability. If security gets in the way of productivity, users will find a different, less secure way to do their work. SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business allow your organization to go beyond its regular business rhythms and be nimbler in responding to market changes and opportunities. These solutions enable users to access the files and documents they need wherever they're doing work, while sharing and collaborating in real-time. And you control and own your data while Microsoft takes care of it - [click here](http://sharepoint-infographic.azurewebsites.net/) to explore the many options SharePoint and OneDrive provide to secure you and your information and then read our eBook [Securing your content in the new world of work with SharePoint and OneDrive](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=55242)¬ù. **What's coming next with Administration and Manageability?** In Q4 CY2017 we will begin rolling out the new SharePoint admin center. From the home page, you'll notice just how much better it is, with interactive activity reports, Message Center posts, and a health dashboard tuned to the needs of SharePoint administrators.

And we know you'll love the dynamic new Site Management page, which lets you view, filter, and edit the configuration of all of your SharePoint sites, including sites connected to Office 365 groups.

We're committed to the security, privacy, and compliance of your data, and we continuously innovate intelligent ways to protect your content, and to empower you to govern and manage information. Last month we announced label-based classification for information management policies, which enable a more dynamic governance of content across SharePoint, Exchange, and Skype, and Microsoft Teams. Today we announced upcoming support for customer managed keys. In Q4 CY2017, you will be able to host your own key in Azure. That key be used to further encrypt your data in Office 365, so that should you choose to leave Office 365, you can revoke the key and your data will be inaccessible to the service. We also announced that conditional access policies will be coming to site collections. These policies allow you to define access based not only on user and permissions levels, but also based on the device , the user, or the location. Conditional access policies can currently be applied to your Office 365 tenant as a whole. In late CY 2017 we will allow you to define these policies at the site collection level, so that you can manage security on a granular, use-case basis. Watch the short video here that demonstrates and shares more details about these investments and hope to see you at Microsoft Ignite where you can learn more about what's next for security, compliance, and administration for SharePoint and OneDrive. \[embed\]https://youtu.be/y-BSmEhdk7c\[/embed\]
