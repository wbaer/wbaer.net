Hi Bill... I’m looking for your help with a SharePoint deployment project here in China. I believe the local Microsoft services team requires your help because they lack the product knowledge and the capabilities. We used SharePoint extensively in my previous company and am anxious to make it a success in our current company - Chery Jaguar Land Rover (a China automotive JV). Unfortunately, we continue to run into simple technical issues that the team here has little experience in dealing with. The latest is file migration from our file shares to SharePoint (on Premise because the Microsoft Cloud offering is not a complete offering due to China Cybersecurity legislation). The initial proposal from the team was a rudimentary solution that did not consider incremental migration and other safeguards for our data. Another example is inexperience with RBS (we don’t recommend that in China) and lastly, although we purchased E4 licences, the team is insisting the migration is out of scope. I’ve encouraged the team to escalate to you and your team for over 3 months now, but it seems I keep getting escalated within the PMO and now someone from Australia is involved. I don’t know where to turn, and thought I’d attempt to reach out to you however I could get a hold of you. Your product and my project are suffering as a result of the teams’ inexperience. Previously, I spent close to 30 years as an IT Director with GM and am very familiar with the capability available within Microsoft. Let me know if you are able to discuss.
