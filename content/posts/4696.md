Today at the SharePoint Virtual Summit, we unveiled the latest innovations for SharePoint and OneDrive, including powerful integrations across Office 365, Windows and Azure. Innovation in the cloud drives tremendous business value, and it delivers new capabilities to the IT professionals who work tirelessly to support, configure, administer, and secure their organizations' content and services. We've built Office 365 with global scale, exceptional reliability, and support for compliance across every industry and geography. On top of intelligent security that keeps your service and content protected and private, we give you granular and dynamic controls so that you can manage access and distribution of your organization's sensitive information. We've equipped you with detailed activity and usage reports. And we've brought the innovations born in Office 365 to SharePoint Server with out-of-the-box capabilities and connected, hybrid experiences. While our new user experiences are designed to be simpler, more intuitive, and more powerful we also believe administration should be just as simple, just as intuitive, and just as powerful, and to that, later this year we're introducing a completely revamped SharePoint Admin center that draws heavily on our modern principles. An administrative console designed to help IT achieve more, so their users can achieve more. **Home** The redesigned "Home" is designed to surface the most important information and quickly help you discover some of the most important information about the service, both its health, and how your organization is using SharePoint Online.

Closely aligned with the OneDrive Admin Center, our sharing controls are designed to help your users make the most of their work all the while making it easy for you to control the flow of your organizations information.

With the upcoming SharePoint Admin Center, you can quickly access and use these policies to address your unique business needs.
