The Beginning.
==============

![](http://wbaer.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/2c08b-2006.png) Our inaugural SharePoint Conference took place in Bellevue, Washington in May 2006, with Keynote speaker Bill Gates calling SharePoint the most “revolutionary” element in all of Microsoft Office, and an eager group of hardcore techies listened as announcements, demonstrations, and previews detailed the future of information sharing with the upcoming release of Office SharePoint Portal Server 2007. SPC06 outlined where we wanted the industry to go, and how we were going to get it there… together. By the end of the week, more than sixty different sessions had discussed hundreds of topics including workflow, collaboration, higher connectivity, tablet computers, and advanced web services. The ideas were audacious, and the bars were set high, but one thing was certain… SPC was here to stay. SPC08 once again rocked the greater Seattle area. Attendance had more than doubled since the first SPC and a highly energized community began to develop out of the rapidly growing user base. Attendees kicked back at social events, formed running groups, clubs, and other extracurricular activities, and shared stories and laughs at the numerous networking opportunities surrounding the conference. It was an action-packed week of SharePoint and fun, and it remains an extraordinary experience for the SharePoint community who attended.

What happens here, stays here…
==============================

SharePoint conference was now the main event on the calendar of IT Pros, Developers, and SharePoint stakeholders around the world. The technical aspect of the conference was anchored by the major SharePoint 2010 announcement, which would place SharePoint at the center of a connected intranet and internet, and create a seamless and integrated experience for users. The attitude at SPC was once again charged by the attendees, as partners, sponsors, community members and Microsoft experts came together for the largest SharePoint event yet. Attendance had again nearly doubled. SharePoint was connecting people and information in an unexpected way. There were sessions, workshops, and labs during the day, followed by dancing and celebrations at night. The atmosphere was palpable, and the combination of new SharePoint material and nonstop social happenings kept the crowds coming back for more. Oh, and did we forget that Huey Lewis showed Sin City that it’s “Hip to be Square” against a backdrop of fireworks in front of screaming SharePoint crowds? No we didn’t. And if you were there, neither did you.

The happiest place on earth.

Conference regulars showed the ropes to first-time attendees and community members traded their Twitter handles and connected on LinkedIn. At night, a spontaneous party grew into what would be called “Club SPC” and quickly overflowed into an adjacent hotel space dubbed “Lounge SPC”. Cocktails and business cards were handed around as DJs spun tracks onto the three floors of partygoers. Outside, Disney parades and fireworks erupted throughout the park while the announcement that SPC12 would be returning to Vegas rung out. Once again, SPC had been a resounding success. Driven by strong sessions, visionary speakers, informative videos, and amplified by an enthusiastic community, word was spreading through the social sphere that SharePoint Conference was not be missed.

Share more. Do more.
====================

Having recently acquired Yammer, the conference highlighted how enterprise social was changing the way people worked together. It was a perfect match for the conference, which has always been about how people connect. During the keynote, #SPC12 became the top trending tweet on the planet. SPC12 also welcomed a new audience to team up with the Developer and IT Pro audiences: Executives. SPC now boasted over 20,000 minutes of expert content targeted towards the three main SharePoint communities. Mandalay Bay was illuminated with life as raffles, giveaways, and armfuls of swag by day turned into mouthwatering food, choreographed dancing, and lasting friendships by night. People cheered from balconies and lined the pools as Bon Jovi shook the city at the SPC12 private party, sandwiched between days of deep dive sessions and engaging workshops and labs.

Connect, reimagine, transform…
==============================

Microsoft took over Venetian Hotel and Resort in Las Vegas, Nevada from March 3-6th for the largest and most comprehensive event on the planet for SharePoint, Yammer, Office 365 and related technologies with a keynote delivered by former President Bill Clinton. #SPC14 launched Office Delve, a renewed enthusiasm for Yammer, and of course the Office Graph.    

Connect. Collaborate. Create.
=============================

![](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2019/01/IMG_0082-1024x768.jpg) After a brief 4 year hiatis, the SharePoint Conference returned in the Spring of 2018 to a familiar location, Las Vegas, Nevada at the world famous MGM Grand. The 2018 SharePoint Conference was the first SharePoint Conference that served both an in-person audience of 2500+ attendees, but also an online audience who tuned in to our live streamed keynote as part of our SharePoint Virtual Summit! SPC18 was 2018’s premier event for SharePoint and related technologies, featuring over 140 sessions (8,400 minutes) of content under one roof. SPC18 was a celebration not only of the return of the SharePoint Conference, but also the community that makes it all possible – in addition to some of the world’s best speakers and authorities on Office 365, SPC18 closed out the event with the world’s best party band the B-52s!  

It’s time to bring the community back together again!
