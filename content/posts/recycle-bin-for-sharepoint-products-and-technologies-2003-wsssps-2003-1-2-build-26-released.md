I've published **Recycle Bin** 1.2 (Build 26) to **SharePoint Tools GotDotNet Workspace**, this build addresses two long-standing bugs:

> Fixes Explorer View bug:
> 
> Unable to delete <file>
> 
> An error occurred accessing your **FrontPage** web files. Please contact the server administrator.
> 
> Fixes Empty Library archiving:
> 
> Document and Picture Libraries that do not contain content will be archived in effort to mirror the directory structure of a Document/Picture Library and its' subfolders if they exist.
