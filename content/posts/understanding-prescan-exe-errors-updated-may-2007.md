I've updated my post Understanding PRESCAN.EXE Errors to include new errors and solutions. Read more here: [http://blogs.technet.com/wbaer/archive/2006/12/22/prescan-errors-what-they-mean.aspx](http://blogs.technet.com/wbaer/archive/2006/12/22/prescan-errors-what-they-mean.aspx).

Excerpt:  "“An outbound zone URL is configured for something other than the default zone on virtual server [http://fabrikam/](http://fabrikam/), and no default zone outbound URL is defined.  This is not supported, and must be corrected before upgrading.”"
