Join me Monday, November 12, 2012 @ 11:00 A.M. in Mandalay Bay GIJK as I discuss what's new for IT Professionals in SharePoint Server 2013.  In this fast-paced session we'll discuss some of the most compelling and important new capabilities and features in SharePoint Server 2013, demonstrate those capabilities and features, and provide references to additional resources where you can learn more about them in depth.  If you haven't done so visit [http://www.mssharepointconference.com](http://www.mssharepointconference.com) and add the session to your calendar.

Upon conclusion of the session I’ll share a series of posts here that provide additional details on each new capability or feature discussed.  To be notified of new posts, [subscribe](http://blogs.technet.com/b/wbaer/rsscomments.aspx#) or filter posts by [SPC219](http://blogs.technet.com/b/wbaer/archive/tags/SPC219/).
