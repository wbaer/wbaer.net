I just learned I'll be co-presenting with Joel Oleson at **TechReady**4 in the IW306 **SharePoint Products and Technologies 2007**: Administrative Architecture and Planning for Deployment - Part 1 (breakout session), scheduled for February 7, 2007 13:30 - 14:45.  If your planning on being in the Seattle area attending this years' **TechReady** - this will be an invaluable architecture and planning session!
