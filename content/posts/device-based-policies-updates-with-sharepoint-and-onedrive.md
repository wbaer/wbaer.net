The risks to information exposure have increased in today’s collaboration landscape because users don’t always work on desktop computers. Access controls now need to account for users connecting their mobile devices to non-secure networks or using their own unmanaged devices. These new access controls start with conditional access policies. Conditional access allows you to keep your corporate data safe while providing your users a secure environment in which they can work from any device. Conditional access in SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business offers security that goes beyond user permissions. It considers the identity of the user, the devices and applications being used, the network that the user has connected to, and the sensitivity of the data being accessed. In March 2017 we introduced device-based policies for SharePoint and OneDrive, enabling administrators to configure Tenant-level policies. Device-based policies for SharePoint and OneDrive in help administrators ensure data on corporate resources is not leaked onto unmanaged devices such as non-domain joined or non-compliant devices by limiting access to content to the browser, preventing files from being taken offline or synchronized with OneDrive on unmanaged devices. On September 1st, 2017 we’ll continue to evolve our conditional access investments to address the ever-changing security landscape and business needs by introducing new levels of granularity with conditional access that allow administrators to scope device-based policies at the site collection level. In addition, this granular policy can be configured to allow users on unmanaged to edit Office Online documents in the browser. **Configuring Policies** Once available in First Release Tenants site-scoped device-based access policies can be configured with [SharePoint Online Management Shell](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35588). Before you get started using PowerShell to manage SharePoint Online, make sure that the SharePoint Online Management Shell is installed and you have connected to SharePoint Online. **NOTE** The Tenant-level device-based policy must be configured to Full Access prior to configuring site-scoped policies.

We understand that there is no security without usability. If security gets in the way of productivity, users will find a different, less secure way to do their work.  Learn more about how we address our customers security and compliance concerns with the resources here. eBook – [Securing your content in the new world of work with SharePoint and OneDrive](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=55242) Visual Interactive – [Share with confidence with SharePoint and OneDrive](http://sharepoint-infographic.azurewebsites.net/) Learn more about device-based policies at [https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/wbaer/2017/03/09/device-based-conditional-access-policies-rolling-out-to-first-release-for-sharepoint-and-onedrive/](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/wbaer/2017/03/09/device-based-conditional-access-policies-rolling-out-to-first-release-for-sharepoint-and-onedrive/).
