Last month we announced open beta for the next generation of the SharePoint Migration Tool with new capabilities to include support for SharePoint Lists, programmatic destination site creation and more.  Today we’re pleased to announce this version (v2) of the SharePoint Migration Tool is now generally available. The [SharePoint Migration Tool](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/SharePoint-Blog/General-Availability-of-the-SharePoint-Migration-Tool-amp/ba-p/143689) is designed to simplify your journey to the cloud through a free, simple, and fast solution to migrate content from on-premises SharePoint sites and file shares to SharePoint or OneDrive in Office 365.  The SharePoint Migration Tool allows you to accelerate your journey to Office 365 overcoming obstacles typically associated with migration projects.  With the SharePoint Migration Tool you can evaluate and address the information that matters the most to your organization, the Libraries, and now Lists that form the foundation of the SharePoint experience.  Using the SharePoint Migration Tool you can start your migration today and take advantage of the full suite of features and [security capabilities](https://aka.ms/SharePoint-Security) that Office 365 offers.

New On-Premises AuthN Support
-----------------------------

Improvements in the AuthN support now allow you to connect to more on-premises sources with support for AD FS and more, to include:

*   NTLM
*   Kerberos
*   Forms
*   ADFS
    *   MFA
    *   SAML Claims
*   Client certificates

Site Structure Creation
-----------------------

Now when migrating your on-premises Lists and documents the SharePoint Migration Tool will create the source site collection or the list for you if it doesn’t already exist, so you don’t have to manually create a destination site. Simply either enter a URL that exist or a valid new URL for the site and the tool will do the rest.

JSON Support
------------

In the current version of the SharePoint Migration Tool you were limited to CSV as a repository for bulk migrations, now on top of supporting a CSV format for automated migration we will also support JSON which will allow you even more fine grain level of control. ![](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2018/05/SPMT-JSON-930x1024.png)

Through continued innovation across migration scenarios we’ll be adding more capabilities over time to the SharePoint Migration Tool, including support for more SharePoint versions, site structure migrations, and more.  Subscribe [here](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/gxcuf89792/rss/board?board.id=SPBlog) to stay up to date on future announcements for SharePoint and Office 365.
