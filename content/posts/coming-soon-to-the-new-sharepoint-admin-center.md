In May 2017 we unveiled our plans \[[https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/SharePoint-Blog/Introducing-the-new-SharePoint-Admin-Center/ba-p/70294](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/SharePoint-Blog/Introducing-the-new-SharePoint-Admin-Center/ba-p/70294)\] to simplify SharePoint administration through delivering an administrative experience that’s intuitive, intelligent, and simple.  Since then we’ve made available the new admin experience as Preview for customers who have enabled Targeted Release at the Tenant level.  In the next several weeks in our preview we’ll be introducing new updates on our journey to deliver an administrative console designed to help IT achieve more, so their users can achieve more. ![](http://wbaer.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/f5fe1-welcome.png)

Improvements to Site Management
===============================

Export
------

New export capabilities allow you to export the displayed information in Site Management to CSV on both PC and Mac.  Using this output you can now use popular tools such as Microsoft Excel and PowerBI to simplify data prep, drive ad hoc analysis, and create dynamic charts and graphs. ![](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2018/03/ExportToCSV-1024x576.png)

Custom Views
------------

In the upcoming updates you’ll now be able to customize views based on your individual preferences in addition to updating and customizing the default view of sites and related information. ![](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2018/03/CustomViews-1024x576.png) **NOTE** Views you create are shared across all admins on the new SharePoint admin center.

Search Improvements
-------------------

If you have hundreds or even thousands of sites, they can be difficult to discover through a single view.  New search improvements will allow you to search across Site Management to find the right information when you need it whether searching by site name, Url, or the primary admin.

Site-Level Sharing for Standalone Sites
---------------------------------------

SharePoint was born on the concept of sharing and now we’re bringing that core principle to SharePoint admin center by enabling management of site level sharing settings for non-group-connected sites. We will follow this shortly with support for group-connected sites, and also support for advanced sharing settings. In case you're wondering, yes, we are working on a new tenant-level sharing page. ![](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2018/03/Sharing1-1024x683.png) ![](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2018/03/Sharing2-1024x576.png)

Improved Email Layout
---------------------

We’re also updating the email layout when contacting site administrators through the SharePoint admin center to make it cleaner and easier to read. ![](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2018/03/Email-1024x683.png) These updates will begin rolling out to Targeted Release in 4-8 weeks. We're looking forward to the ongoing feedback. Use the feedback button at the bottom right of the new UI.  Also, if you see a survey that pops up and asks you how you feel about the new site, don't be shy, let us know.
