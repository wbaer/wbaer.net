Webmentions -

Over the past several weeks as I've continued to shift from dynamic to static, I've at the same time become more and more interested in Indieweb - as part of that exploration webmention has become more an interest to me (to which you'll see here I've started to take advantage of).

So what is webmention?  Well, as defined by the W3C, webmention is a simple way to notify any URL when you mention it on your site. From the receiver's perspective, it's a way to request notifications when other sites mention it.

Put into simpler terms, webmention is a standardized protocol that enables one address to notify another address that the former contains a reference to the latter - while allowing the latter to verify the authenticity of the reference.  One can draw comparisons here to the humble @mention to which we're all familiar.  Regardless of canvas, it's likely you've become accustomed to this relatively standard way of communication, whether in consumer scenarios such as Twitter, Facebook, etc. or within the boundaries of commercial experiences, such as Microsoft Word.  Mentions have become the defecto mechanism to let you know you have been referenced directly or tagged in a post or photograph. 

So why webmention?  Here enters the problem, what if your web post is mentioned on Twitter, or you're mentioned on Facebook but otherwise don't have a Facebook account?  Webmention provides the "connective tissue" across these otherwise disconnected experiences, mitigating the reliance on proprietary, black-box services to stitch together unrelated platforms and considering the increasing importance of privacy and identity protection, different use cases, the burden of additional usernames and passwords, and the time involved, many people donâ€™t want to do this.

Webmention solves the problem surrounding disparate, fragmented solutions by allowing notifications between web addresses. To simplify further, if you mention this post on Twitter or Facebook, it will generate a mention here - even where I don't have an active Facebook account.

While brief, I plan to expand on the "art of the possible" and how to get started with webmention in future posts.
