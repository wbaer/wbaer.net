Cross-posted from my post on the Microsoft Technical Community at [https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/SharePoint-Blog/Hybrid-Scenarios-with-SharePoint-and-Office-365-Updates-and/ba-p/47571#M204](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/SharePoint-Blog/Hybrid-Scenarios-with-SharePoint-and-Office-365-Updates-and/ba-p/47571#M204). _Ubiquitous connectivity, the proliferation of devices – the rise of the cloud._ The cloud has become mainstream and services such as Office 365 are an attractive alternative to on-premises business solutions with SharePoint.  However, for a variety of reasons, you might want to or need to deploy specific solutions in the cloud while still maintaining your on-premises investments.  For some organizations, you may wish to gradually move to cloud using a staged, workload-driven approach.  Hybrid scenarios with Office 365 and SharePoint on-premises allow you to bring the cloud to your business while bringing the business to the cloud.  From on-premises to the cloud and back—your information is where and when you want, at your pace, using the investments you already have. Your existing solutions coexist with the cloud—without the full cost of migration. You can even use Delve and Power BI with on-premises data. \[office src="https://onedrive.live.com/embed?cid=DB2A854820FFC537&resid=DB2A854820FFC537%21118642&authkey=APh205PNzGbGK9E" width="320" height="180"\] The cloud is no longer a luxury—it’s central to a mobile, modern workplace—and Office 365 brings the cloud to you, on your terms and across SharePoint and OneDrive we’re constantly working to help you take advantage of the power of Office 365. In November we announced [preview availability of two new hybrid scenarios](https://blogs.office.com/2016/11/08/feature-pack-1-for-sharepoint-server-2016-now-available/) coinciding with Feature Pack 2 for SharePoint Server 2016 – hybrid auditing and hybrid taxonomy.. **Hybrid Taxonomy (Generally Available)** _Today we’re pleased to announce hybrid taxonomy is generally available._ Taxonomy is key to promoting discoverability and access to the right information at the right time. Hybrid taxonomy in SharePoint Server 2013 and SharePoint Server 2016 allows customers to bring their taxonomy store to Office 365 enabling a single-source for creating and managing Terms, Term Sets and Groups through a single Managed Metadata Service. **Hybrid Auditing (Preview)** Hybrid auditing is a new feature that aims at helping administrators manage their SharePoint infrastructure by giving them access to various reports and dashboards in Office 365. The reports are generated from SharePoint Server 2016 on-premises diagnostic and usage logs. If you opt in for this service, audit logs get collected and uploaded to Office 365 regularly. From the Office 365 dashboard, you can view auditing and activity reports that show usage and reliability patterns in your SharePoint Server 2016 farm alongside data from your SharePoint Online tenant. _Hybrid auditing will become generally available later this calendar year._ Learn more about hybrid scenarios with Office 365 and SharePoint on-premises at [http://hybrid.office.com/](http://hybrid.office.com/). **Resources** Download the hybrid scenarios pocket guide with SharePoint and Office 365 at [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=842608](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=842608).
