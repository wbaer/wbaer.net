A recently published whitepaper is now available on TechNet that describes the benefits of deploying Microsoft SharePoint Server 2010 on Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2 Enterprise Edition and scenarios in which its features can be applied.

**Excerpt**

Microsoft® SharePoint® Server 2010 is the business collaboration platform for the enterprise and the Internet. SharePoint Server 2010 has become a business-critical application and an integral part of business processes. To help IT infrastructures to remain flexible and scalable to help support, manage, and secure expanded functionality, an influx of additional users and locations, and increasingly robust applications such as SharePoint Server 2010, we recommend that you choose the Windows Server® 2008 R2 Enterprise operating system during initial deployment.
