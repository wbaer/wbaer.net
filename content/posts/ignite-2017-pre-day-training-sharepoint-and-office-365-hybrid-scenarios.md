Join myself, Neil Hodgkinson, Spence Harbar, Bob Fox, and other industry experts for a Microsoft Ignite pre-day training on implementing hybrid scenarios with SharePoint and Office 365.

Cloud computing has become a popular way to reduce capital and operational expenditures, renew IT innovation, and gain the advantage of more rapid software delivery to meet the needs of business. However, compliance, data sovereignty, sensitivity concerns, or a significant investment in customization may limit your organization's ability to take advantage of this. Today you can maximize your on-premises investment by upgrading to SharePoint Server 2016 and using hybrid scenarios in Office 365 to seamlessly leverage the cloud. This pre-day workshop is designed to give you the deep technical knowledge to deploy SharePoint Server 2016 as well as design and implement the latest hybrid scenarios including search, auditing, taxonomy and more.

Attendees will receive instructor led training on best practices for implementing a variety of hybrid scenarios and workloads, training materials, to include documentation and presentations and a each, a dedicated lab environment including a SharePoint Server 2016 farm and an Office 365 Tenant that can be used to complete hands on labs during and after the event.
