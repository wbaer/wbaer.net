The 2019 SharePoint Conference is just a little over seven months away.  And we're pleased to announce our global Call for Papers! The SharePoint Conference has an amazing line-up planned for 2019 and we're looking for great speakers and content to round out our agenda. Do you have a great story to tell?  Do you have a passion for sharing your knowledge with others?  Do you like helping others solve common challenges?  Do you love to share customer success stories, best practices, teachings, and how-tos?  If you answered yes to any – or all – of those questions, then we want to hear from you! If your submission has been selected, you will receive a complimentary full conference pass to SPC19. Please use one form per contribution – multiple contributions are accepted. Submit proposals at [https://sharepointconferencecfp.hubb.me/](https://sharepointconferencecfp.hubb.me/). Looking for more great news? Keep up to date at https://sharepointna.com/#!/news.
