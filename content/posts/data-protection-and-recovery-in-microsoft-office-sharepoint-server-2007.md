Data protection and recovery is a strategic requirement for most organizations considering Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007; until recently most of the information available on item to farm level recovery, both for planning and implementation, were scattered across the Internet, available in pieces on a collection of blogs and sites.  Today I'd like to announce the culmination of several weeks of work by many dedicated and bright individuals with the publication of a new whitepaper [Data protection and recovery for Office SharePoint Server in small to medium deployments](http://technet2.microsoft.com/Office/en-us/library/288fecfb-53fb-4988-89d7-b7888f82bf961033.mspx?mfr=true) ([http://technet2.microsoft.com/Office/en-us/library/288fecfb-53fb-4988-89d7-b7888f82bf961033.mspx?mfr=true](http://technet2.microsoft.com/Office/en-us/library/288fecfb-53fb-4988-89d7-b7888f82bf961033.mspx?mfr=true)).
