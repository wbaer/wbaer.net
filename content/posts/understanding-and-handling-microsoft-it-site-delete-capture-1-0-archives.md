Since the initial release of the Microsoft IT Site Delete Capture 1.0 Feature, one of the most commonly reported issues has been the inability to restore a site archive generated by the application.  The Microsoft IT Site Delete Capture 1.0 Feature uses basic STSADM principals to both backup and restore site collections and sites; however, generates its archives using one unified file extension (.BAK) for both operations as opposed to manifest files commonly associated with site export operations and single file associated with site collection backups.

**Error:  Your backup is from a different version of Windows SharePoint Services and cannot be restored to a server running the current version. The backup file should be restored to a server with version '1178817357.0.106094.0' or later**.

To restore a site collection archived by the Microsoft IT Site Delete Capture Feature 1.0 use the `STSADM -o restore` operation (see below for parameters).

`For site collection restore:  
    stsadm.exe -o restore  
        -url <url>  
        -filename <filename>  
        [-hostheaderwebapplicationurl <web application url>]  
        [-overwrite]`

This command would commonly be used where the site to be restored was hosted under a path such as http://<server>/sites/<site>.

To restore a site archived by the Microsoft IT Site Delete Capture Feature 1.0 use the `STSADM -o import` operation (see below for parameters).

`stsadm.exe -o import  
           -url <URL to import to>  
           -filename <import file name>  
           [-includeusersecurity]  
           [-haltonwarning]  
           [-haltonfatalerror]  
           [-nologfile]  
           [-updateversions <1-3>  
               1 - Add new versions to the current file (default)  
               2 - Overwrite the file and all its versions (delete then insert)  
               3 - Ignore the file if it exists on the destination]  
           [-nofilecompression]  
           [-quiet]`

This command would commonly be used where the site to be restored was hosted under a path such as http://<server>/sites/<site>/<sub\_site>
