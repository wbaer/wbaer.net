**Customers with Service Pack 1 Deployed**

For customers who have previously deployed Service Pack 1, download the updated Service Pack 1 and install over the existing Service Pack 1 running PSConfig or PSConfigUI immediately following.

**Customers without Service Pack 1**

For customers without Service Pack 1 deployed, download the updated Service Pack 1 package and deploy as per the KB documentation.

**MSDN ISO**

There is no update to the integrated ISO on MSDN as it was not affected by the issue.

A potential issue with the following Service Pack 1 packages may prevent customers with Service Pack 1 from deploying future Public and/or Cumulative Updates.  As a precautionary measure we have deactivated the download page until a new package is published.

For customers who have downloaded Service Pack 1, but have not deployed Service Pack 1, we recommend you postpone deployment until an updated package is delivered (date is TBD).
