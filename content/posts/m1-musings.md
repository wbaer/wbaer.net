More or less a random musing...

Today is just shy of 3 weeks since I received my M1 MacBook Pro (MPB) and I while I had experienced some initial issues (now resolved), I can say the experience thus far has been a positive one.  

The performance improvements are unquestionable - my current MBP (Apple Silicon, 16GB MBP) is replacing a mid-2017 (Intel i5, 16GB MBP), both with 512GB storage.  While I don't often perform resource intensive tasks, I wanted my new MBP to represent its predecessor as closely as possible to compare overall performance.

ISSUES

The one initial issue I did have was related to iCloud failing to sync.  Given this was a new MBP absent data and applications at the time, I elected to start from a clean install, removing and formatting all partitions.  Once I had done so and reinstalled Bug Sur - I ran into an issue during MacOS setup where I was unable to create a user account. In the event it's helpful the error itself was **Computer account creation failed** Your computer account could not be created with the name and password specified.  Please try again.

When attempting to create the account again an error was presented that that the name was already in use...effectively a shadow was created.

Following several reinstall attempts and the same occurring, I new something was amiss.

Most of the instructions you'll find online today (related to the M1) suggest you put the non-working MacBook Pro in DFU via Configurator and a second MacBook - while I could've done so, it seemed a bit of trouble for a new MBP so I attempted something different (again in the event someone else has this issue):
