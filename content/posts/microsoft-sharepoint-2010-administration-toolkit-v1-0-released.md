We've recently released the first administration toolkit for SharePoint Foundation and SharePoint Server 2010.  The toolkit includes a new User Profile Replication Engine, a new Security Configuration Manifest, a new Content Management Interoperability Services (CMIS) Connector, and the Load Testing Kit (LTK).

**User Profile Replication Engine**

The User Profile Replication Engine was first introduced as a standalone application in later adminisration toolkits for Office SharePoint Server 2007 to replicate profiles between Shared Services Providers (SSP).  The User Profile Replication Engine for SharePoint Server 2010 was built on Windows PowerShell and now enables the replication of Profile and Social data between the User Profile Service Application in SharePoint Server 2010, in addition to backwards compatibility with Office SharePoint Server 2007 SSPs.  These improvements enable replication between SSP’s or User Profile Service Application services, as well as across versions.  Note Replication is limited to Profile data, SSP's in Office SharePoint Server 2007 contains no Social activity tracking.

**Security Configuration Manifest**

The Security Configuration Manifest is an attack surface reduction feature in Windows Server products.   The manifest inlcuded in the administration toolkit adds roles for SharePoint 2010 to Windows Server 2008 with SP2 or Windows Server 2008 R2.

**Content Management Interoperability Services Connector**

The Content Management Interoperability Services (CMIS) Connector enables consumers of SharePoint to interact with content stored in any repository that has implemented the CMIS standard and in additional enables SharePoint 2010 content to be available to any application that has implemented the CMIS standard.

**Load Testing Kit**

The Load Testing Kit (LTK) generates a Visual Studio Team System 2008 (VSTS) load test based on Windows SharePoint Services 3.0 Internet Information Services logs.  Load test can be used to generate synthetic load against SharePoint 2010 as part of a capacity planning exercise or a pre-upgrade stress test.
