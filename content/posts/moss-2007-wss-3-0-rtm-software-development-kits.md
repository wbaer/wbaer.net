The **Windows SharePoint Services 3.0** RTM Software Development Kit have been released to [MSDN](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms472057.aspx); for those looking for the **Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007** Software Development Kit [click here](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms550992.aspx), each includes documentation, as well as code examples within the topics and contains the highest-priority documentation for developing on each platform.  I'd be interested to hear what others are developing and how the information contained in the SDK's contributed to that project.
