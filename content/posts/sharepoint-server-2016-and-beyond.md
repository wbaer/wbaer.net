Today at the [SharePoint Virtual Summit](https://aka.ms/SharePointSummit), we unveiled the latest innovations for SharePoint and OneDrive, including powerful integrations across Office 365, Windows and Azure - and while we continue to drive forward with a cloud-first, mobile-first vision - we're excited to also announce new innovation for our customers on-premises. When we launched SharePoint Server 2016 in May of 2016, we shared a vision of a server that was cloud-born and future-proof.  A new, modern version of SharePoint that shared a codebase with SharePoint Online enabling us to deliver at a more rapid cadence.  Innovation that is born in the cloud, innovation to help you succeed with the cloud, and most importantly, innovation based on your feedback. Over the past year, we've made significant progress against those goals, shipping our first Feature Pack, Feature Pack 1, introducing compelling new cloud coexistence capabilities, and making SharePoint Server 2016 available via the Microsoft Azure Platform Gallery. **Resources** Get technical resources for SharePoint Server 2016 at [https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc303422%28v=office.16%29.aspx](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc303422%28v=office.16%29.aspx).

We enhanced the SharePoint Framework with new extensions for sites and libraries. We added endpoints to Microsoft Graph, and new webhooks.  You can learn more about these announcements at dev.office.com. And, today, we announced that we will bring the first components of the SharePoint Framework to SharePoint Server 2016 with Feature Pack 2, later this year. This will enable developers to use a modern, client-side development model to create web parts and solutions that can power new solutions on-premises, in hybrid experiences, and in Office 365. While Feature Pack 1 was one that delivered IT innovation to our customers of SharePoint Server 2016 with new compliance, coexistence, and deployment investments, Feature Pack 2 is designed to bring the latest developer investments with the SharePoint Framework.
