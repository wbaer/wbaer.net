Over the past several weeks myself and Rick Taylor, you may know him from various conferences, MCTs, or as a contributing author to the [Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 Administrators Companion](http://www.microsoft.com/MSPress/books/9537.aspx), have been engaging the [Edge](http://edge.technet.com/) crew to establish a new series - dubbed the R&B Show.  Our focus will be an entertaining look into the daily lives of a MSIT technologist and we'll be covering topics specific to Microsoft SharePoint Products and Technologies such as FBA, BDC, Search, Shared Services design, architecture and engineering, etc., all set to the music of local area bands.  We'll take you through the product lifecycle for all those interested in seeing a hosted SharePoint offering evolve, planning meetings, design meetings, spec reviews, a trip around campus, and a one on one with our manager - including some bonus content too exciting to give away here and more...we are open to suggestions to topics most interesting to you so please let us know here or through the shows' comment board.  Our premier will be filmed on Wednesday and after some editing magic will be available on [http://edge.technet.com/](http://edge.technet.com/) and as soon as it is published I'll let you know here.  Stay tuned, this is something you won't want to miss!

As a teaser - we'll be incorporating fruits, vegetables, adhesive tape, and one unsuspecting manager in the show.
