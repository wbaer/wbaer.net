In order to remain competitive in today’s business climate you need to be able to respond to change and challenges quickly.  Sometimes that means adjusting your SharePoint infrastructure on a moment’s notice to maintain a competitive advantage. 

Procuring and managing hardware can be costly and time consuming – and sometimes it may only be needed temporarily.  Infrastructure as a Service solves these challenges through a ready-to-use, pay as you go solution which means you can deploy in hours as opposed to days.  With Windows Azure Virtual Machines and SharePoint 2010 you can rapidly deploy and host your business websites on a secure, scalable cloud infrastructure scaling as your website traffic grows and paying only for what you use.

Windows Azure Virtual Machines enable organizations to deploy custom Windows Server images to Windows Azure.  Virtual Machines provide developers complete control of the application environment and allow easy migration of existing applications to the cloud.  To learn more about Windows Azure Virtual Machines see also [http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/home/scenarios/virtual-machines/](http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/home/scenarios/virtual-machines/).

Windows Azure Virtual Machine sizing flexibility allows IT organizations to support a variety of SharePoint scenarios from single large VM instances for development purposes to scalable server farm topologies to support collaboration or web content management.
