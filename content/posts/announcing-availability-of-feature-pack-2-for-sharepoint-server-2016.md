When we launched SharePoint Server 2016, we shared the vision for SharePoint Server 2016 as a foundational release, born in the cloud, and built for continuous innovation. Today we’re pleased to announce our continued investments on this journey and commitment, the availability of Feature Pack 2. Through the September 2017 Public Update for SharePoint Server 2016 we’re delivering several new features based on customer feedback and developer needs, highlighting these investments, the SharePoint Framework. The SharePoint Framework (SPFx) is a page and web part model that provides full support for client-side SharePoint development, easy integration with SharePoint data and support for open source tooling. With the SharePoint Framework, you can use modern web technologies and tools in your preferred development environment to build productive experiences and apps on SharePoint that are responsive and mobile-ready from day one! Feature Pack 2 for SharePoint Server 2016 contains the foundation of modern web part hosting and editing experiences, including core SPFx APIs, SPFx package deployment, and property panes.
