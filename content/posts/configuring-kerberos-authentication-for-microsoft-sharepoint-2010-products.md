We’ve recently published a new whitepaper that describes the core concepts of identity in SharePoint 2010 and Kerberos’ role in authentication and delegation.  The whitepaper is divided into nine (9) core scenarios:

Scenario 1: Core Configuration  
Scenario 2: Kerberos Authentication for SQL OLTP  
Scenario 3: Identity Delegation for SQL Analysis Services  
Scenario 4: Identity Delegation for SQL Reporting Services  
Scenario 5: Identity Delegation for Excel Services  
Scenario 6: Identity Delegation for Power Pivot for SharePoint  
Scenario 7: Identity Delegation for Visio Services  
Scenario 8: Identity Delegation for Performance Point Services  
Scenario 9: Identity Delegation for Business Connectivity Services
