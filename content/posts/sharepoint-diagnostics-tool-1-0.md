I completely missed this one; the [SharePoint Diagnostics Tool](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=1C222804-51C7-4BB5-AE3D-89C68AD27A78&displaylang=en) was recently released (included in the [Microsoft SharePoint Administration Toolkit v3.0](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=412A9EF1-3358-4420-B820-0CA3F4641651&displaylang=en)).  The SharePoint Diagnostics Tool enables an administrator to simplify troubleshooting by gathering pertinent information about a farm and displaying it in a meaningful way providing a programmatic approach to locating and isolating issues in your environment.  Find it and other great tools and utilities under Tools.
