I visited [http://www.carbongrove.com](http://www.carbongrove.com/) on the commute home this evening and planted SharePoint.  Watch SharePoint grow at [http://www.carbongrove.com/Trees/243029#g=0](http://www.carbongrove.com/Trees/243029#g=0 "http://www.carbongrove.com/Trees/243029#g=0") or plant your own!

In partnership with a world leader in planting trees for environmental restoration, Windows Internet Explorer will sponsor the planting of up to 250,000 real trees in deforested regions around the globe.

Users simply need to visit their tree once a week and watch it grow.  After six weeks of your carbon reducing efforts, Windows Internet Explorer will sponsor the planting of a real tree.
